        "1.What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   - Python is a popular, versatile, and easy-to-learn programming language widely used for web development, data science, machine learning, and automation, due to its simple syntax, extensive libraries, and a large, supportive community.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "  - An interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine-readable instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  - Python Keywords are some predefined and reserved words in Python that have special meanings. Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding. The keyword cannot be used as an identifier, function, or variable name.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "  - No. we can not use keywords as variable names because keywords are reserved words with predefined meanings that the interpreter or compiler uses to understand the structure of the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, mutability refers to an object's ability to be changed or modified after it's created, with mutable objects allowing in-place modifications, while immutable objects require creating new objects for any changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "  - Lists are mutable because they are built to allow dynamic changes in content. You can modify a list without creating a new one, which can make your code more efficient when working with large datasets or objects that require frequent modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The immutability of tuples comes from their role in making data structures more predictable and safer, especially when you want to ensure the data doesn't accidentally get altered. This also makes them hashable, meaning tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries or stored in sets (which lists cannot).\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "  - == checks whether the values of the two objects are the same, regardless of whether they are stored in the same location in memory.\n",
        "  - is operator checks whether the two objects are the same object in memory (i.e., if they refer to the same location in memory).\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, logical operators, also known as Boolean operators, are used to combine or modify conditions and return a Boolean value (True or False). The main logical operators are and, or, and not.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, type casting is the process of converting a variable's data type from one type to another, like converting an integer to a float or a string to an integer.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "  - Implicit type casting happens automatically by the compiler, while explicit type casting, also known as type conversion, requires the programmer to explicitly instruct the conversion.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "  - Conditional statements in Python, like if, elif, and else, allow programs to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false, enabling dynamic and responsive behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  - The “elif” keyword in Python, stands for “else if”. It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions. For example, if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  - The main difference between for and while loops lies in their purpose: for loops are used when you know the number of iterations beforehand, while while loops are used when the number of iterations depends on a dynamic condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "  - Scenario: Reading User Input Until Valid Data is Entered\n",
        "Suppose you're writing a program where you need to ask the user to enter a positive number. The loop should continue asking the user for input until they provide a valid response (a positive number). Since you don’t know how many times the user will enter invalid data, a while loop is more appropriate here.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "# Keep asking the user for input until they enter a positive number\n",
        "number = -1  # Initial invalid value\n",
        "\n",
        "while number <= 0:\n",
        "    number = float(input(\"Please enter a positive number: \"))\n",
        "    if number <= 0:\n",
        "        print(\"That's not a positive number. Please try again.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "print(f\"Thank you! You entered {number}.\")\n"
